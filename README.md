# Hi there, I'm Aditya

I'm a dev and security researcher. I am currently working as an SRE in <a href="https://github.com/shuffle">@Shuffle</a>.

I participated in Google Summer of Code '22 with <a href="https://github.com/intelowlproject">@IntelOwlProject</a> and <a href="https://github.com/honeynet">@HoneyNet</a> and mentored for GSoC'23.
I like backend, blockchain, security, devops and a few other things here and there.

Used to volunteer for building tech for infosec communities. Now, helping build companies and open-source software.
